The code is simple and to the point which makes it easy to know what is going on even if there were no comments. There are enough comments to know what you are using each method to accomplish. I could easily follow along with you code the entire time.
I didn't find any software defects, the program seems like it would work as intended.
I feel like your code was very similar to mine, I'm sure that will change as we learn more and get further into the semester.
The only comment I have is keep up the good work, I think you will do great this semester.
