The code compiles and runs without any errors or warnings.
The code is readable, method names are descriptive, and there are comments for almost every method.

A suggested improvement would be to elaborate a bit more on the comments
where the logic may not be immediately obvious.

It seems that all of the code is actively used and relevant.
No defects were found.

Try-catch blocks could be used with the methods that interact with the database.

The UI is easily usable and readable.
