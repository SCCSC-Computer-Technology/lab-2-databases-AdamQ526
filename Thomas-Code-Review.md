I cloned Adamâ€™s repository and found no errors upon compilation. After running the program and testing it, I found no errors. The code was easily readable and well-documented.

One thing that Adam did differently was that he included a details form to simplify data entry. He also removed the navbar from the form with the datagridview. However, users can still edit the values in the datagridview despite not being able to save the changes. This can be resolved by setting the datagridview to read-only, and for the sake of the user, setting the selection mode to FullRowSelect.
